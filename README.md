## Rajawali + 3D Audio (OpenAL) Example

> [OpenAL (Open Audio Library)](http://www.openal.org) is a cross-platform audio application programming interface (API). It is designed for efficient rendering of multichannel three-dimensional positional audio. Its API style and conventions deliberately resemble those of OpenGL. Early versions of the framework were open source software, but the later revisions are proprietary.

This example integrates the OpenAL native library with Rajawali. It uses the light-weight [OpenAL Android library created by Martin Pielot](http://pielot.org/category/android-2/openal/).
